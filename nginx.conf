    # Note: For Docker deployment with proxy support, you'll need a separate
    # backend service to handle API proxying. Consider using:
    # - A Node.js Express server
    # - Or configure nginx as a reverse proxy
    # 
    # Example nginx proxy configuration (add to this file if needed):
    # location /api/proxy/qqu/ {
    #     proxy_pass https://u.y.qq.com/;
    #     proxy_set_header Host u.y.qq.com;
    #     proxy_set_header Referer https://y.qq.com/;
    # }
}
